# Data-Mining_Recommeder-System
## Attributed Social Networks and Application for Recommender Systems
### Performed research on data mining, feature engineering, and recommendation systems.
### In this research project, new features was generated from original data as well as extended structural definitions of node metrics, like degree, centrality, clustering coefficient and community.
### The size of the IMDB dataset is 10M, 20M, and 50M. Recommended results are based on user behavior like movie watched, and user ratings towards movies.
###  
### Similarity is computed in sim-cosine and asym-cosine. Cross validation is applied.
### Cleaned the data with Python, removing special characters, wrong punctuations.
### Encoded movie names and features into vector representations.
### Boosted recommendation time efficiency by 270% using parallel computing in C++.
