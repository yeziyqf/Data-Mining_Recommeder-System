# Data-Mining_Recommeder-System
## Attributed Social Networks and Application for Recommender Systems
    ### Performed research on data mining, feature engineering, and recommendation systems.
    ### In this research project, we generated new features from original data as well as extended structural definitions of node metrics, like degree, centrality, clustering coefficient and community.
    ### The recommended results are based on user behavior like the movie watched, and user ratings towards movies.
    ### Boosted recommendation time efficiency by 270% using parallel computing in C++.
